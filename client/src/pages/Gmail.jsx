    definition:
      "Think of Gmail as your personal mailbox—but online. Instead of waiting for letters to come in the mail, emails arrive instantly on your computer or phone. No stamps, no waiting, no trips to the post office—just type, send, and your message arrives in seconds. It’s perfect for staying in touch with family, sending messages to businesses, or signing up for things like doctor’s appointments and newsletters.\n\nGmail is like your home mailbox, but faster, safer, and always available.",

    whyUse: [
      "Keep in touch with family & friends – Send messages to kids, grandkids, or old friends without worrying about losing their number.",
      "Get important updates – Many businesses, doctors, and banks use email to send appointment reminders, receipts, or updates—this way, you never miss anything.",
      "Safer than regular mail – Unlike paper mail that can get lost or stolen, Gmail keeps your messages private and secure.",
      "Use it for everything – Want to sign up for Facebook, shop online, or get digital coupons? Most websites ask for an email—this is where Gmail comes in!",
      "It's completely free!",

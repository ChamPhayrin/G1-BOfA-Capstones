    // What's FB
    definition:
      "Think of Facebook like a giant community bulletin board, but instead of walking down to the local center to check it, you can see it from the comfort of your home. It‚Äôs a place where your kids and grandkids post pictures‚Äîso you don‚Äôt have to wait for holiday cards in the mail. It lets you stay in touch with old friends‚Äîmaybe even that buddy from high school or a cousin you haven‚Äôt seen in years. You can join groups for hobbies you love‚Äîgardening, classic cars, cooking, church groups, you name it. In short? Facebook helps you stay connected without having to figure out texting, group chats, or a hundred different apps.",

      "Join communities for things you love ‚Äì Love classic cars, knitting, cooking, music, or church groups? There are Facebook groups where people just like you share tips and chat daily.",
      "Easier than you think ‚Äì If you can dial a phone or send a letter, you can use Facebook. It‚Äôs just a few clicks.",

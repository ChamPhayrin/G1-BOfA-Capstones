          What Is Facebook?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Think of Facebook like a giant community bulletin board, but instead
          of walking down to the local center to check it, you can see it from
          the comfort of your home. It‚Äôs a place where your kids and grandkids
          post pictures‚Äîso you don‚Äôt have to wait for holiday cards in the mail.
          It lets you stay in touch with old friends‚Äîmaybe even that buddy from
          high school or a cousin you haven‚Äôt seen in years. You can join groups
          for hobbies you love‚Äîgardening, classic cars, cooking, church groups,
          you name it. In short? Facebook helps you stay connected without
          having to figure out texting, group chats, or a hundred different
          apps.
